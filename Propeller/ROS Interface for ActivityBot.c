 ActivityBot (AB) code to connect to Dr. Rainer Hessmer's
 ROS with Arduino project: https://code.google.com/p/drh-robotics-ros/
 This code is largely a sloppy "conversion" of Dr. Hessmer's robot.pde for the Arduino:
 https://code.google.com/p/drh-robotics-ros/source/browse/trunk/Arduino/Robot/Robot.pde
 Dr. Hessmer's blog explaining how his code and robot works is here:
 http://www.hessmer.org/blog/2010/11/21/sending-data-from-arduino-to-ros/

 Please also see these sites which helped me tremendously with the formulas:
 http://www.seattlerobotics.org/encoder/200610/article3/IMU%20Odometry,%20by%20David%20Anderson.htm
 http://webdelcire.com/wordpress/archives/527
 And of course the entire point of this is to interface with ROS, so read about everything ROS here:
 http://wiki.ros.org/
 All code here heavily borrowed from everywhere code can be found! :)
 See "Serial Testing for ROS ActivityBot 1-4" (which are not on GitHub) for previous versions and explanations.

"The most impressive is that we can use the same code as the ActivityBot examples, replacing only the library’s name. So everyone who has a big-size Robot, similar to The Artist (like Arlo, Eddie or any other) must only change the library “abdrive.h” with the “arlodrive.h”. So we can take all the advantages form the pre-written code for the ActivityBot!'
