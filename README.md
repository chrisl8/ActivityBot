ActivityBot Package for ROS
===========================

This code is no longer maintained. I have migrated fully to the ArloBot https://github.com/chrisl8/ArloBot

If you would like me to update this code to make it usable please file an issue and I will get it up to date. Otherwise I will assume that no one is interested in this anymore.

This is my attempt to build a Package for the Robot Operating System (ROS) to work with the Parallax Propeller based ActivityBot

Please note that you will also need the code to run on your Propeller board. This is stored in the Propeller folder. Hopefully catkin won't mind too much?
