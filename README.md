ActivityBot Package for ROS
===========================

This is my attempt to build a Package for the Robot Operating System (ROS) to work with the Parallax Propeller based ActivityBot

Please note that you will also need the code to run on your Propeller board. This is stored in the Propeller folder. Hopefully catkin won't mind too much?
